# predicting_data_breach_size

The purpose of this paper is to use firmâ€™s revenue, number of employees, type of data breach, and number of vulnerabilities to predict the size of a data breach for 2018, and determine the importance of the variables on predicting data breach size. Size of data breach is defined as the total number of records compromised. Data is collected from Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC) while vulnerability data is from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and company data is collected from various sources. Multiple linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoosting are used to analyze the data. XGBoosting provides the best results with a root mean squared error of 4,399,552. Natural log of revenue, number of daily vulnerabilities, unintentional disclosure, and number of employees are the first, second, third, and fourth most important variables in predicting data breach size.
